          Hey offworlder! Welcome to The Great White Tail.
Get ready for an adventure of a lifetime!

Let me fill you in on a little history. Almost a millennia ago, planet Earth was a beautiful blue and green marble, a paradise for our species.

After the turn of the millennium (2760 AD), humans got a little ahead of themselves and began developing technologies at such a rate that our planets resources were exhausted.

Finally, after around 100 years another planet, where you come from, was found. It shared a similar air quality and other attributes to support life. A “Goldilocks planet” they called it. Just enough of everything for our species to survive and go on. The planet was located in the Andromidax system, 13,000 light years away. That’s when interstellar travel was born.

Humans began leaving Earth by the thousands. It wasn’t until after a few launches that they realised what had gone wrong. The fuel used for interstellar travel produced a greenhouse gas with a potency never before seen.

This resulted in the progression of global warming at unprecedented levels. The polar ice caps melted and sea levels rose engulfing all but this small land mass you’ve come to visit.

Bet they didn’t teach you that one in the history books did they?

Well anyway, here you are. As you can see, life has adapted and changed. We are the precipice of something astounding. This volcano you see before you, long thought to be extinct, has began erupting. The sulphur dioxide it is releasing into the atmosphere is causing a local cooling effect on the environment.

Professor Hammerhead needs your help to figure out what’s going on!
